# Object-Tracking-Using-YOLOv8-and-StrongSORT

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python script for real-time object tracking using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for object detection and the StrongSORT (Strong Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for object tracking. The implementation utilizes the imageNet and the OSNet models for improved performance.

## Setup and Requirements

TO install YOLO : ```pip install ultralytics```

Make sure that you fulfill all the requirements: Python 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt]() dependencies installed, including torch>=1.7. To install, run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

I have downloaded the strongSORT algorithm from here: [strongSORT](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov7_StrongSORT_OSNet/tree/main/strong_sort) and modified according to my use case.
