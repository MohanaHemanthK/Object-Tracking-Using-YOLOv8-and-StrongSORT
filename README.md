# Object-Tracking-Using-YOLOv8-and-StrongSORT

This repository contains a Python script for real-time object tracking using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for object detection and the StrongSORT (Strong Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for object tracking. The implementation utilizes the imageNet and the OSNet models for improved performance.
